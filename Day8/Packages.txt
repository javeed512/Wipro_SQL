*Packages:
A package is collection of logically related sub programs.
Creation of package invokes two steps.
Step 1: creating package specification.
Step 2: creating package body.

Package specification: package specification contains declaration of sub programs.
Package body: package body contains definition of sub programs.

Example of Packages:

step1: package specification
----------------------------

CREATE OR REPLACE  Package   my_package
IS
Procedure  p1;

end  my_package;

step2: package body
-------------------

CREATE OR REPLACE   Package Body  my_package 
IS
Procedure p1
IS
Begin

DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('P1 Procedure created inside package');

end p1;

end  my_package;

SQL> desc my_package;
PROCEDURE P1

SQL> execute  my_package.p1;
P1 Procedure created inside package
