Sub queries:-
============

Different ways of writing sub-queries

1. select * from table  where ..  (subquery)   group by ...  having .. (subquery);
SQL> select * from employee where dno = (select dno from dept where location = 'Hyderabad');      
OR Alternate for above using Joins
SQL> select eid , ename, job , salary ,d.dno  from Employee e , Dept d where e.dno = d.dno and                         location = 'Hyderabad';


2. select (sub-query)  from table;

SQL> select  EName, Salary , (select sum(salary) from employee) - salary  total_budget        from employee;

3. select  * from  (sub-query) alias;

SQL> select  eid,ename,salary,job  from  (select  EID,ENAME,SALARY,JOB from employee)  E;


SQL> select  ename , DOJ  from  (select  EID,ENAME,SALARY,JOB from employee)  E;
select  ename , DOJ  from  (select  EID,ENAME,SALARY,JOB from employee)  E
                *
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00904: "DOJ": invalid identifier

select  *  from  (select  * from employee  WHERE Job IN ('Developer','Tester'))  E;


CO-RELATED SUB-QUERIES:
=======================

Oracle performs a correlated subquery when the subquery references a column from a table referred to in the parent statement. A correlated subquery is evaluated once for each row processed by the parent statement. The parent statement can be a SELECT , UPDATE , or DELETE statement.

Corelated sub query in update statment:

SQL> update  designation_masters set  design_name = 'Teacher'                                 where design_code =(select design_code from designation_masters where design_name= 'Reader');

Corelated sub query in delete statement:

SQL> delete  designation_masters where   design_code =                                               (select design_code from designation_masters where design_name = 'Lecturer');


Sub query to CREATE Copy of  table with or without records:
-------------------------------------------------------------
with records
SQL> CREATE TABLE  Employee2  AS (select * from Employee);


without records
SQL> CREATE TABLE Employee3  AS (select * from employee  where  1 = 2);
